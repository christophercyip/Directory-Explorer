Directory-Explorer
==================

Just a simple little program which displays some bars which indicate how much space files and subdirectories are taking up in a specified parent directory on your computer.  Because of screen space limitations, directories which have lots and lots of files/subdirectories will have all but the largest 30 bundled up into a single bar at the bottom.  Not very elegant, I know.

Since I also packaged it all into a .jar, I also made it so that if it takes longer than a minute to scan through the subdirectories, it will ask if you want to stop the program.  While the program doesn't have a particularly large amount of overhead, it will keep running unless you stop it somehow, hence this sort of a workaround.  Sometimes you have lots of subdirectories in places...

This is one of those "I have an idea for some random program, maybe I should make it" types of programs, I guess?
